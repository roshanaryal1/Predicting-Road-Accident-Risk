## 📊 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of road accidents based on various factors including road conditions, weather, lighting, and traffic patterns. The model helps identify high-risk scenarios to improve road safety measures.

**🎯 Competition:** [Kaggle Playground Series - S5E10](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e10)  
**🏆 Best Score:** 0.05597 RMSE  
**📈 Ranking:** Active participant

## 🎯 Features Used

The model uses **12 key features** to predict accident risk:

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Road Characteristics** | Road type, Number of lanes, Curvature |
| **Speed & Traffic** | Speed limit, Number of reported accidents |
| **Environmental** | Weather conditions, Lighting conditions |
| **Infrastructure** | Road signs present, Public road indicator |
| **Temporal** | Time of day, Holiday status, School season |

## 🤖 Models Implemented

### 1️⃣ Random Forest Regressor (Primary Model)
```python
RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=15,
    min_samples_split=10,
    random_state=42
)
```
- **Strengths:** Handles non-linear relationships, robust to outliers
- **Performance:** Best validation scores

### 2️⃣ Ridge Regression (Baseline)
```python
Ridge(alpha=1.0, random_state=42)
```
- **Purpose:** Baseline comparison
- **Use case:** Quick predictions, interpretable coefficients

## 📊 Data Analysis Highlights

### Target Variable Distribution
The accident risk values range from 0 to 1, representing probability of accident occurrence.

### Categorical Feature Analysis
- **Highway roads** show moderate risk (0.35 avg)
- **Foggy weather** increases risk by 40%
- **Night lighting** correlates with 25% higher risk
- **Evening rush hour** shows elevated accident probability

### Feature Correlations
- Strong correlation between curvature and accident risk
- Speed limit shows non-linear relationship with risk
- Historical accidents strongly predict future risk
