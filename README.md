## ✨ Features

-   **🔮 Real-time Risk Prediction**: Instantly assess accident risk by inputting road, weather, and traffic conditions.
-   **📊 Interactive Gauge Chart**: Visualize the predicted risk probability on a color-coded gauge for immediate understanding.
-   **💡 AI-Powered Recommendations**: Receive dynamic, context-aware safety tips based on the provided conditions to help mitigate risks.
-   **📈 Model Insights**: Explore the Random Forest model's performance metrics and the most influential features driving its predictions.
-   **🎨 Professional UI**: A modern, responsive, and visually appealing "glassmorphism" interface built for a superior user experience.
-   **☁️ Auto-Training on Deploy**: The app automatically trains the ML model on the cloud server if it's not already present, a clever workaround for deployment constraints on large model files.

## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualizations

The model's predictions are driven by key insights derived from the data. Here are some of the visualizations from the analysis phase:

### Feature Importance
This chart shows which factors have the most impact on the model's predictions. `num_reported_accidents` and `curvature` are clearly the most significant predictors.

### Model Comparison
Different models were evaluated, with Random Forest providing the best performance for this regression task.

### Correlation Matrix
This matrix helps visualize the relationships between different features in the dataset.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Development)

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
-   Python 3.11+
-   `pip` package manager

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roshanaryal1/Predicting-Road-Accident-Risk.git
cd Predicting-Road-Accident-Risk
```

### 3. Set up a Virtual Environment
Using a virtual environment is a best practice for managing project-specific dependencies.
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Model Training Script
The Streamlit app requires the model files to be present. Run the training script first to generate them locally.
```bash
python3 train_and_save_model.py
```
This will create the `model/` directory containing `accident_risk_model.pkl` and `label_encoders.pkl`.

### 6. Launch the Streamlit App
You're all set! Launch the application.
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
✅ The application should now be running in your default web browser.
